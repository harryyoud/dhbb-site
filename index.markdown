Dove Holes Brass Band was established in 1877. It originally supported local
functions but later in competed successfully in contests, including Belle Vue
where they won over ten contests.

In 1933, it was reported that Dove Holes Band was one of the best for many
miles. In 1948, after the war, the band was rebuilt with many young people
receiving tuition and thrived again providing music for the local community.

The list of prizes won by the band from 1925 until 1968 is long and
illustrious.

Our real home is in Dove Holes in the beautiful Peak District of Derbyshire,
England. We are a varied team ranging from under ten to over eighty years old.
Our musical abilities vary from the absolute beginner to budding maestro. We
are a now a non-contesting band providing concerts of a high standard.

We are available to play concerts and at various events, subject to
availability and travelling distance.

We always welcome players, new and not so new to our band. Training is normally
available for those who need a little help getting started. We do however seek
some form of commitment from our players in that once established, we would
expect regular attendance at rehearsals and engagements.

Our rehearsals are Thursdays 7:30-9:00pm. You are welcome to turn up. Our band
room is between 1 and 1A Dale Road, Dove Holes, just put the postcode SK17 8BG
into your sat nav.
