As part of a fundraising campaign to both raise the public profile of the Band
and to earn money to spend on new equipment and music, we run the Dove Holes
Band 100 Club.

To put it simply, you give £12 a year (pro rata) to the Band and will be
allocated a ball number. A numbered ball will be drawn on the first week of
every month. The winner will receive £25.

The winner will be contacted, shown on the website, on our Facebook page and in
the Band room window. If you want some more information or are thinking of
joining, contact us.

The £25 prize can be collected from the Band on one of our rehearsal nights
(Tuesday & Thursday: 7:30pm to 9:00pm)
