Bringing new people into the band is very important for us. This is why we
offer the opportunity for new players to be taught on a band-provided
instrument for free.

Juniors (over the age of 7) are given the free use of an instrument and free
tuition until they are competent enough to join the senior band. At this
point, they will be provided with free uniform and will continue with tuition.
They are initially taught individually then taught as a group. The junior band
practice as a small group at 6:30pm, and are provided with the opportunity to
perform at some of our concerts.

We currently have a thriving junior band, who we are very proud of, thanks to
the marvellous tuition received from our two tutors. If you or your child is
interested in joining the band, please
[contact us]({% link contact-us.markdown %}), we will reply as soon as
possible.
