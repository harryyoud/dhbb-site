  I am sorry for the delay in contacting your good selves. I was at the Saint
  Georgeâ€™s day parade celebrations. I have been attending the event anally and
  have to say the band sounded totally different, in a good way. I was very
  impressed when you played abide with me outside the church. I was even more
  impressed inside our beautiful church. You formed at the alter and produced
  this wave of passion. You have definitely improved since last summer, I am not
  musical in any way shape or form but I noticed that the band seemed more
  disciplined, obviously Mr Thompson has now retired all I can say is welldone
  to whoever chose your conductor. He has sharpened you all up.

  We at Parwich would love to see you again. I would have no hesitation in
  recommending yourselves.
