  Thoroughly enjoyed my first rehearsal at band last week! After moving to the
  area, I chose to join Dove Holes Brass Band due to a recommendation, and the
  fact the band do not contest. After contesting for many years, I am relieved
  to join a band who put in time and effort to have a great sound and aim to
  provide a great concert for the public!
