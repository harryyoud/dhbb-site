  Sorry this thank you note is so late.

  You performed for my parents, Tom and Biddy Hilton at Hassop Hall on 9th
  August on their 70th wedding anniversary. I’d like everyone who came to know
  how very much their performance was enjoyed by all of us. My father was very
  emotional about the whole thing and it really made the occasion truly
  memorable. I like to think that the inclusion of “He’s my brother” in the
  programme was a deliberate reference to the very recent passing of my uncle,
  Edward Hilton. Anyway, we all took it that way and found it very moving and
  thoughtful of the band. We have happy memories of the day.
