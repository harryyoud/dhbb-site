We are a friendly non-contesting band, based in the beautiful Peak District,
rehearsing on Tuesday and Thursday evenings (7.30pm – 9:00pm) and have a
sensible balance of concerts in a range of venues.

You will find we are a fantastic sociable band who benefit from also having a
thriving junior band.

with you.
